                      diff_match_patch.py


## Usage (Android & iOS) ##

first you should install node_modules with **package.json** like zhis:
    
    cd [rootpath]
    npm install

after you finished this,u can use this script:

    python patch.py

## Logic of diff  ##
For every **jsbundle** in the project,i use [**google-diff-match-patch**](http://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/) (Copyright 2006 Google Inc.)to compute the diff of the old one and the new one.

For every **Image** file in the project,i only put the image which has been changed or first add to the project.

In the end,zip the diff floder for publish.
